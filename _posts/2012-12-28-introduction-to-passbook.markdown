title: Introduction to Passbook
---

On January

Passbook is new open standard developed by Apple which allows users to quickly access scannable barcodes and other information useful for real-world situations from their iOS devices. These situations include scanning boarding passes, redeeming coupons, or showing a membership card among other available actions.

In this session we will learn what a Passbook pass is made up of, design guidelines for a pass, and how to create a pass from within your own application. We will also touch on how these passes can be updated and what is needed to support a pass from your own server including the creation of passes and how to support push notifications. This session will show how you can interact with Passbook from your server using Ruby and how you can interact with Passbook from your iPhone applications using Passkit.
