title: Introduction to Rails 4
---

Toledo needs a group that is less concentrated on a programming language, framework, or technique, and more open to new languages, frameworks and techniques. That is what Dev Toledo is all about.

We are a group of software craftsman that want to learn and share knowledge with others in the area. It doesn’t matter if you’re a .NET developer, an iOS developer, a Ruby developer, or a Front End developer. We hope you will come out and join us.

Our first meeting is November 15th at 6:30 pm @ Seed Coworking in Downtown Toledo. Scott Radcliff will discuss the new and deprecated features of Rails 4.
