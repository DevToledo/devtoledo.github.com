title: Go Go Gadget _____
---

Are you tired of programming in languages from the 80's and 90's? Sick of the 'slow' performance of 'pretty' languages like Ruby or Python? Why not try Go?

Go is shiny new language created at Google. It's fast, it's functional, it can do some pretty cool stuff.

In this 'choose your own adventure' style talk I talk about what you want me to. Well not really... you'll get to choose between building a command line tool with Go or building a simple, performant web application. Through building something we will explore some of the nuances of this exciting new language without the boredom of just reading the docs.

It goes without saying that this talk will not be extremely in depth and it will (hopefully) be accessible to even the newest of programmer.

Meeting date and time: Thursday February 14th @ 6:30
