# DevToledo Home Page

DevToledo is a platform and language agnostic user group. We exist for the sole purpose of learning new things and being exposed to new things that we wouldn't have in a dedicated user group. This site is completely open source and we are always looking for help with maintaining it and improving it.

Here are a few things that we could use help with:

* Logo and/or site design
* RSS feed
* Comment integration
* Overall code improvements

If you are looking to help, there are a few dependencies that you should be aware of.

## Dependencies

* Jekyll
* Sass

If you are new to either of these, no worries. Here are some resources to help you out. If you are still unsure, fire off an email to [scott@scottradcliff.com](mailto:scott@scottradcliff.com) and I'll help anyway I can.
